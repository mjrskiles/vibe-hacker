## No Backwards Compatibility

When refactoring or making changes:

- **DELETE old code entirely** - do not deprecate, comment out, or keep "for reference"
- **Do NOT add backwards-compatibility shims**, re-exports, or migration helpers
- **Do NOT document "the old way"** - there are no users to migrate
- **If something is unused after a change, remove it completely**
- **Prefer clean breaks over gentle transitions**
